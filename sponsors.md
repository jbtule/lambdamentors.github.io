The sponsors of Lambda Mentors help us build a strong programming industry, an industry where we share knowledge to grow, where we welcome enthusiasm and support growth. Sponsoring companies value people at all levels of programming skill, from high potential to deep experience. We want the world to know this. Sponsors are featured on the Lambda Mentors and Lambda Lounge web pages, thanked in our twitter feeds, and displayed at every Lambda Lounge meeting of senior developers in St. Louis. We are honored when a Lambda Mentors sponsor lists this organization among their community involvement.

Donations are fully tax-deductible; they go directly to charity. Lambda Mentors is entirely volunteer-driven. All donated money contributes directly to our community, added to the impacts on education and the local software industry.
