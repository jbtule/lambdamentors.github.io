Lambda Learners are people who have gotten a glimpse of the computer programming
field, want to pursue it, and need help from an established developer. Lambda
Mentors can be a resource for answering questions and working through problems
in self-study, computer science curriculum. Learners participating in the program
are paired with a mentor who will be available to guide and collaborate with
them on their programming projects.  Mentors can also recommend books and blogs
to read, conferences they should attend, and open source projects that learners
could participate in to future their experience in the development community.
The Lambda Mentors program is free for learners. All that is expected of them
is a keen interest in computer programming and a commitment to make good use
of the time spent with their mentor.

After learners and mentors meet for mentoring sessions, the mentors publish a
summary of the activities from the meeting and make plans for the next time the
pair will get together.  Those reports appear on this site.  If you would like
to participate in the Lambda Mentors program as a learner, please send an email
to [Mario](mailto:mario@lambdamentors.org).
